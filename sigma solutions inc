Personal loans and personal lines of credit are two ways to borrow money that typically don’t require collateral. However, they’re functionally different. A personal loan gives you a lump sum of money upfront and requires fixed monthly payments throughout your loan term. On the other hand, a personal line of credit lets you withdraw as much cash as you need at any point in time and pay it back on your own timeline with a variable interest rate.

Both personal loans and personal lines of credit can be a good way to borrow money; the best one for you depends on your financial habits.
