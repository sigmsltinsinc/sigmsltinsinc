Personal loans are a type of loan that gives you a fixed amount of funding distributed in a lump sum. They are generally used for one-time expenditures. Your payments with a personal loan will be the same each month because they have fixed interest rates and a fixed repayment timeline. You can get a personal loan from a local bank, credit union or online lender.
