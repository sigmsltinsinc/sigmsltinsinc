A personal line of credit, like a credit card, is an unsecured revolving credit line with a credit line limit and a variable interest rate. A personal line of credit could be an ideal solution if you’re trying to manage purchases and aren’t clear on the overall scope of the costs. While your payments on a personal line of credit will change due to variable interest rates, you’ll pay interest only on the portion of the credit line that you use. Personal lines of credit may be available from your community bank or through a variety of online lenders.
